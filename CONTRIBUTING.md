# Contributing to IntruderDetectionCamera

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

1. Reporting a bug
2. Discussing the current state of the code
3. Submitting a fix
4. Proposing new features
5. Becoming a maintainer

# Report bugs using Github's issues

  Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

# Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

Great Bug Reports tend to have:

1. A quick summary and/or background
2. Steps to reproduce
   - Be specific!
   - Give sample code if you can. 
3. What you expected would happen
4. What actually happens
5. Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
